Converting binary to decimal:
	- Multiply each bit by 2^n starting at n = 0
	- Start with the rightmost bit
	- Take the sum for the result
Converting decimal to octal:
	- Multiply each bit by 8^n starting at n = 0
	- Start with the rightmost bit
	- Take the sum for the result
Converting hexadecimal to decimal:
	- Multiply each bit by 16^n starting at n = 0
	- Start with the rightmost bit
	- Know the decimal number for the hexadecimal characters
	- Take the sum for the result
Converting fixed point decimal to binary
	- Divide decimal number by 2 and keep track of the remainder 	(either 0 or 1)
	- Binary number starts at the bottom
Converting floating point decimal to binary
	- Do the left side of the decimal like a fixed point
	- Multiply digits to the right side of the decimal by 2
	- The left side of the decimal will either turn to 0 or 1 
	which will be the binary number
	- Each time you multiply by 2, don't multiply the digit to 	the left of the decimal
Converting octal to binary
	- Convert each individual digit to binary
Converting hexadecimal to binary
	- Convert each individual digit to binary
Converting decimal to octal
	- Divide the number by 8
	- Keep track of the remainder
	- Final number goes bottom to top
Converting binary to octal
	- Split the number into groups of 3
	- Convert each binary number to their decimal equivalent
Converting binary to hexadecimal
	- Split number into groups of 4
	- Convert each group individually
Converting octal to hexadecimal
	- Convert each digit to binary, making sure that the binary 	strings are 3 bits long
	- Line up the binary number and split it into groups of 4
	- Convert the groups to hexadecimal
Converting hexadecimal to octal
	- Convert each digit to binary, making sure that the binary 	strings are 4 bits long
	- Line up the binary number and split it into groups of 3
	- Convert the groups to octal
Binary coded decimal number
	- Each digit of the decimal number written as binary
2's compliment
	- Invert the number and add 1 to it
Overflow
	- Overflow occurs when the final carry bit is not equal to 	the leftmost bit
