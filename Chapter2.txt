Decoders
	- Size: n-to-m (n x m) where m is less than or equal to 2^n
	- The decimal number of the input (i.e 011 = 3) goes to the that output (i.e D3)
	- NAND Gate Decoder
		E	A1	A2	D0	D1	D2	D3
		0	0	0	0	1	1	1
		0	0	1	1	0	1	1
		0	1	0	1	1	0	1
		0	1	1	1	1	1	0
		1	X	X	1	1	1	1
		- Fills opposite to a not NAND gate decoder (1 is usually along the diagonal with 0 everywhere else)
	- Creating large decoders out of smaller ones
		- 3 x 8 = Two 2 x 4
		- Both decoders take the same enabler but one takes the NOT enabler while the other takes it with no gates. When one decoder is enabled the other is disabled
Encoders
	- Opposite of a decoder
	- Size: m-to-n (m x n) where m is less than or equal to 2^n
	- Outputs:
		- A0 = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7
		- A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7
		- A2 = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7
Multiplexers
	- Takes 2^n input lines and produces one output line
	S1	S0	Y
	0	0	I0
	0	1	I1
	1	0	I2
	1	1	I3
Registers
	- A group of flip flops where all flip flops can store at least 1 bit of information
	- Parallel loading
		- When all bits of the register are loaded simultaneously with a common clock pulse transition
	- Shift register
		- A register capable of shifting its binary info in one or both directions
		- One direction: unidirectional
		- Both directions: bidirectional
			S1	S0	Operation
			0	0	No change
			0	1	Shift right (up)
			1	0	Shift left (down)
			1	1	Parallel load
Binary Counters
	- Lower order bit is complimented after every count
	- Other bits are complimented if all lower order bits are 1
Memory Unit
	- Writing data
		- Apply desired address locations on address lines
		- Apply data to data input lines
		- Activate write
	- Reading data
		- Apply address of desired word
		- Activate read
		- Data output valid after specified access time
	- RAM: Random access memory
	- ROM
		- RAM without write capability
		- Really just a truth table
	- PROM: Programmable ROM
	- EEPROM: Electronically ereasable PROM	
	- Standard memory unit
		- Address line k
		- Data input n
		- 2^k words
		- n bits per word
		- Data output n
