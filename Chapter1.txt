XOR Gate
	- Output is 0 (false) if and only if the inputs are the same
XNOR Gate
	- Output is 0 if and only if the inputs are different
Precedence
	- Parenthesis, NOT, AND, OR
Minterm (m)
	- Product, sum of products
Maxterm (M)
	- Sum, product of sums
	- m_j = M_j'
AND
	- A * 0 = 0
	- A * 1 = 1
	- A * A = A
	- A * A' = 1
OR
	- A + 0 = 0
	- A + 1 = 1
	- A + A = A
	- A + A' = 1
NOT
	- 0' = 1
	- 1' = 0
	- (A')' = A
Commutative law
	- AB = BA
	- A + B = B + A
Distributive Law
	- A(B + C) = AB + AC
	- A + BC = (A + B)(A + C)
Associative law
	- A(BC) = (AB)C
	- A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
Absorption Law
	- A + AB = A
	- A(A + B) = A
De Morgan's Law
	- (A + B)' = A' * B'
	- (A * B)' = A' + B'
Principle of Duality
	- If an expression is valid in boolean algebra, the dual of that expression is also valid.
	- To form a dual
		- Replace all + with *
		- Replace all * with +
		- Replace all 1 with 0
		- Replace all 0 with 1
K-Maps
	- The cells fill from left to right as
		0, 1, 3, 2
		4, 5, 7, 6
		12, 13, 15, 14
		8, 9, 11, 10
	- Each cell that contains a 1 is part of the simplified boolean expression
	- The rules are
		- Group must be as large as possible
		- Must be of any size 2^n
		- Edges can wrap
		- Groups can not contain a 0
		- Groups can not be made along a diagonal
		- Groups may overlap
		- Each 1 must be in a group even if it's in a group by itself
		- Must create as few groups as possible
	- Don't care conditions
		- If you can guarantee that certain input combinations never occur
		- If some outputs aren't used in the rest of the circuit
		- Can be a 1 or a 0, pick the one that grants the largest simplification
Combinational Circuits
	- Input variables, logic gates, output variables
	- Given a problem statement, you must
		- Determine number of inputs and outputs
		- Derive the truth table
		- Simplify the boolean expression for each output
		- Draw the circuit
	- Half adder
		- Type of combinational circuit with 2 inputs, 2 outputs. Calculates the sum and the carry
	- Full adder
		- Type of combinational circuit with 3 inputs, 2 outputs. Calculates the sum and the carry
Sequential Circuit
	- Implements a combinational circuit and flip flops
	- Flip flops
